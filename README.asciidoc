== Objectives

Study some Reactive Streams stuff (backpressure, etc.).

== Pre-requisites

=== Mongodb

You can install and run a Mongodb docker image:

```
docker pull mongo
docker run -p 27017:27017 --name cara-dojo -d mongo
```

== Examples

=== TwoSubscribersExample

With the http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams/[Reactive Streams Mongodb driver],
all the publishers are cold.
As matter of fact, subscribing twice to a publisher will create two independant streams.

=== RequestPaceSubscriber

This shows how the subscriber can regulate the upstream by controlling the number
of element it can handle before receiving new elements (backpressure regulation)
